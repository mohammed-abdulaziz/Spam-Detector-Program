# Spam Detector

A Java-based spam detection program that uses a probability-driven algorithm (Naive Bayesâ€“style with Laplace smoothing) to classify emails as either spam or ham (legitimate). The program allows users to upload datasets with spam and ham emails, train a classification model, and evaluate the overall performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. This application features a Java Swing GUI for dataset selection, classification results, and performance metrics. The classification results are color-coded: ham emails appear in green, spam emails appear in red, and any misclassified emails are highlighted in yellow.
